	  =============================================

This is a developer release for Isabelle/OFMC, i.e., while it may be
of interested to experts, it is not yet useable by the general
public. This development version comprises a small set of Isabelle
theories and a prototypical tool, called anb2thy. Using OFMC's
fixed-point module, anb2thy generates Isabelle theory files for
protocols that haven been successfully validated by OFMC.
