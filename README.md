# Isabelle/OFMC - Linking OFMC and Isabelle/HOL

This is a developer release for Isabelle/OFMC, i.e., while it may be
of interested to experts, it is not yet useable by the general
public. This development version comprise a small Isabelle
theory and a prototypical tool, called anb2thy. Using OFMC's
fixed-point module, anb2thy generate a Isabelle theory (for 
 [Isabelle 2016](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2016/index.html)) 
file for protocols that haven been successfully validated by OFMC. 

This project has been superseded by [Automated Stateful Protocol
Verification](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Automated_Stateful_Protocol_Verification.html)
and is no longer maintained. In contrast, [Automated Stateful Protocol
Verification](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Automated_Stateful_Protocol_Verification.html)
is actively maintained and also, as official entry of the Archive of
Formal Proofs, always supports the latest version of Isabelle. More
information about the [Automated Stateful Protocol
Verification](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Automated_Stateful_Protocol_Verification.html)
project (including its source code) is available in the AFP:
